Alternatively, you can use `RStudio` in the web browser by launching this Binder instance for free >> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/e-kotov/agit-2025-spanishoddata-playground/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio), limited by 1-2 GB of RAM and 1 CPU core. Source repository is at [https://github.com/e-kotov/agit-2025-spanishoddata-playground](https://github.com/e-kotov/agit-2025-spanishoddata-playground){target="_blank"}.
